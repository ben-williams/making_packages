# Preface {-}

Materials for getting MESA into building R packages and using R markdown/bookdown.
I'll populate this website as we go.

## Why? {-}

An oft asked question is why make an R package, often this is followed with a statement of "I'm the only one who uses this code". There are many reasons for making R packages but a short list is:

 - ease of use, we tend to reuse code, if it is easily available and *documented* it is more likely to be used and kept track of
 - R packages are simple to create
 - forces tidy code and workflow
 - a great way to distribute data and code associated with a paper (or assessment)
 - does not need to be distributed to anyone
 - allows for easy exchange and reproducibility
 - encourages (and provides space for) good documentation (works for data, not just code)
 

## Resources {-}

We will be relying heavily on [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html) and [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).
