Ill populate this website as we go. An oft asked question is why make an R package, often this is followed with a statement of Im the only one who uses this code. There are many reasons for making R packages but a short list is: ease of use, we tend to reuse code, if it is easily available and documented it is more likely to be used and kept track of R packages are simple to create forces tidy code and workflow a great way to distribute data and code associated with a paper (or assessment) does not need to be distributed to anyone allows for easy exchange and reproducibility encourages (and provides space for) good documentation (works for data, not just code) Resources We will be relying heavily on R packages and bookdown.
