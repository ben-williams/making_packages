Ill populate this website as we go. An oft asked question is why make an R package, often this is followed with a statement of Im the only one who uses this code. There are many reasons for making R packages but a short list is: ease of use, we tend to reuse code, if it is easily available and documented it is more likely to be used and kept track of R packages are simple to create forces tidy code and workflow a great way to distribute data and code associated with a paper (or assessment) does not need to be distributed to anyone allows for easy exchange and reproducibility encourages (and provides space for) good documentation (works for data, not just code) Resources We will be relying heavily on R packages and bookdown. "],["setup.html", "1 Setup 1.1 Software 1.2 Packages", " 1 Setup 1.1 Software This will go fastest if you download all of your needed software, place them in a folder on your desktop, then put in a request with IT. Have them install to default settings. Ill drop a line to IT that multiple people will be requesting this. There were substantially changes with the update to R 4.0 so make sure you have switched to at least that version and preferably update to the versions below. To speed things up Ive downloaded all the programs on the google drive R &gt;= v4.1.2 https://www.r-project.org/ Note that you can bypass IT by using the following code (unfortunately it doesnt work for the other programs and Rstudio usually updates when R does) install.packages(&quot;installr&quot;) installr::installr() Rtools v4.0.0 RStudio &gt;= v1.4.1717 most current version is 20201.092+382 Setup a Github account. I recommend setting up a personal account for the time being. Follow this advice at happygitwithr for your username, note that the email you use for Github will have to match the email you configure git with. If you will be hosting NOAA materials here is how to setup a NOAA approved github account Note that you can switch between your personal and professional accounts when needed. We will be using git If you have not used git before and dont have it setup on your machine follow these steps: accept default path C:/Program Files configure git by following happygitwithr instructions. 1.2 Packages There are a number of packages well be regularly using so might as well load them now so we can be sure they are up to date. install.packages(c(&quot;bookdown&quot;, &quot;tinytex&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;devtools&quot;, &quot;roxygen2&quot;, &quot;testthat&quot;, &quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;pkgdown&quot;)) "],["what-is-a-package.html", "2 What is a package?", " 2 What is a package? A package can exist in five different states. source bundled binary installed in-memory If you are creating a package or working on the code you are dealing with the source. Using install.packages() or devtools::install_github() moves a package from source, bundled, or binary states into the installed state (e.g., it is loaded on your computer). The library() function loads the package and makes it available for immediate use. Youve probably heard of a source tarball at that means is that many files have been reduced to one .tar and it was compressed .gz so you get the extension .tar.gz which is a bundled R package (just not in the way you are probably used to).

This creates a basic package that has a hello world function. Really though there are only a few items needed, these are: An R/ directory A DESCRIPTION file - aka metadata A NAMESPACE file - reduce conflicts w/other packages here More information 3.1 What we are going to do Our package will be an RStudio project It will be tracked with git "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
